### Most days start the same.

I wake up, and boot up a laptop.

Then I check my emails, first personal, then work.

I spend maybe 10 minutes top doing this, because I gotta go to the daily stand-up meeting.

I am still in my pajamas.

I have about 10 minutes before my meeting so I make a protein smoothie; it is said that you should try to get 30 grams of protein 30 minutes within waking up.

### What it is like working remotely as a Frontend Web Application Developer.

I save a ton of money/time on my commute since I do not have one.

At my old job I probably spent at least 1 hour a day driving to/from the job.

Working 5 days a week that is (1 hour a day * 5 days a week * 48ish) weeks worked a year is a 240 hours a year makes 10 days of just commuting.

Having those extra days means I get to sleep a little more, or stay up a little longer, anyway I digress... this post is supposed to be about what life is like as a frontend developer.

Frontend is fun, _most_ of the time. 

I personally specialize in HTML/CSS, and that has always been my strong suite. Web apps of course are 99% JavaScript (nowadays TypeScript) and so I got good at that. As a Frontend developer most of my work also have a heavy association with UI/UX which makes me a bit of a designer as well.

I wear a few different hats throughout the day which keeps things interesting, some hats are heavier than others.

Depending on your level and experience you might be part of the architectural process of web app development. Architecture of a web app can be fun if you really like planning and organizing. I personally work in Angular which means a lot of the architectural decisions are influenced by the Angular Style Guide.

At first working remotely can be a pretty lonely experience, being alone all day with only Slack as a means of communication is not a very human experience. I eventually developed a habit of working at a local coffee and pie shop that has fast wifi and free refills. I get my coffee and a little human interaction, and they get my $2 every day, win-win.

I do spend a disproportional amount of time in the shop compared to the other customers, but I think its okay, I have become pretty friendly with the morning crew here and I get free pie from time to time.

Being a frontend developer that specializes in the UI/UX can sometimes be a difficult task. Everyone looks to you as the source of truth for how something should work. Sometimes people will offer their own opinion on how something should look and feel, this is usually a good thing; collaborating with co-workers is a good thing, especially if you are remote.

I work on the same application every single day, and it starts to get dull. It can be difficult to look at the same UI/UX every day. I love experimenting with color and font and shape, and every part of me wants to go crazy and change the layout, or the workflow, but in an enterprise web app you can't just change things willy nilly.

### Working in the Enterprise

The pay is good, the design is bland... for now.

Trying to convince that the powers that be what good design is can be a challenge, especially if those powers that be love excel. In my experience enterprise web app development has mostly been an emotionless design void. It is starting to change though. _Designing for Emotion_ by Aaron Walters is a great book that explains how introducing little things here and there when designing can actually make your users happy.

When I design i try to accomplish 2 things always.

1. Provide a usable solution
2. Make the user happy

\#2 often times falls by the wayside, which can make any project a depressing venture. I mean if I am spending most of my time building something that hopefully someone ends up using I would at least hope that someone has a good time using it. 

I guess this type of worry can be said for any type of work that may end up being used or not used. I suppose the best thing you can hope for to make sure you get something out of it; that is why I approach every day of work as a learning experience.

### Learn Everyday

Web development is a a job that requires constant research in the latest trends and features of the languages used.

A huge trend in the last few years is React development. As I mentioned before I am an Angular developer. The only experience I have with React is a tiny calculator I built years ago and some Gatsby.js websites. I really do not React and I honestly don't get what all the ho-ha is about. I am really looking forward to some static site generators for Angular, scully.io looks promising.

Anyways...

Most days end the same. I design something, I write some code, maybe get a little burnt out.

Sometimes we meet deadlines, and most of the time we don't. It is important to regulate the amount of stress you take in.
