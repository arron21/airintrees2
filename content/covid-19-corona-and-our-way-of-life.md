I should have written this back in February when news of Covid-19 was starting to become more serious.

I believe it is best if we start to accept that as a species:

Our way of life is going to change drastically.

Our government (USA) is not prepared to operate in this type of socio-economic culture.

It will take a least 1 year for things to even begin to "get back to normal".

We were told very clearly early on that the typical time-frame for developing a vaccine takes about 1 year. Unless there is some miracle and some corners cut in the development of the vaccine.

There are only 2 ways we will approach any sort of previous normalcy.

1: mandatory 100% quarantine for 3 weeks and complete shutdown. Only specific government officials are allows to deliver food/necessary goods to those who need them. After 3 weeks we determine who is sick and who is not. Then the sick are put on house arrests and we continue to provide for them until they are well.

\#1 is extremely difficult and highly unlikely in the USA

2: Self Isolate until a vaccine is developed. This is closer to what is currently happening, except that there are people who are not self isolating, which will just create more cases and deaths. 

The numbers do not lie and the number of cases world wide are going to increase, if you go out, you are risking the life of your neighbor.

The amount of protests and lack of respect for this virus is incredible.

The USA response to it is absolutely flabbergasting.

I hope everyone stays safe, stays inside, and respects the fight we still have ahead.

You can't fight hand to hand with a virus, we have to play by it's rules. 

Now is the time to demand the government help us... The People.

Too long have we operated in such a specific mode as a country. Now that we have had such a drastic socio-economic kick in the ass, we are unable to bounce back due to the strict reliance on how our economy has operated for so long. We must demand that our government support its people during this time. We must adopt a new mode of economy and of life, at least until we are certain no more lives are at risk.
