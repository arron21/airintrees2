      <description>I went to the dentist yesterday. I had not been to the dentist in a couple years so I figured I was overdue for a cleaning.
Turns out I was only getting x-rays on this initial visit and I have to go back for a cleaning next week. I have 1 cavity on the side of one of my teeth; I had not noticed it before.
They also want me to consult an oral surgeon because they think my wisdom teeth are going to become an issue in the future.</description>
